**Project Media library**
---

Create an interface with the Tkinter library, allowing to see the list of documents existing on the media library.
There are two types of documents:
- Book
- CD

Please note that the user can only borrow 5 documents at a time and may be penalised for late borrowing. It is also important that a document can only be borrowed once at a time.
